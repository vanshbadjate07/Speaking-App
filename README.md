# Vansh Speaking App

Welcome to the **Vansh Speaking App**, a console-based application that uses the system's text-to-speech feature to speak out any input provided by the user.

## Features:
- Accepts user input from the console.
- Speaks out the input using the system's built-in text-to-speech functionality (macOS only).
- Exits the app when the user types "exit" (case-insensitive).

## Note:
This application currently works **only on macOS** due to the use of the `say` command. To run it on other operating systems like Windows or Linux, you'll need to modify the script to use an alternative text-to-speech command or library.
