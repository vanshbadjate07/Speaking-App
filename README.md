# Vansh Speaking App

Welcome to the **Vansh Speaking App**, a console-based application that uses the system's text-to-speech feature to speak out any input provided by the user.

## Features:
- Accepts user input from the console.
- Speaks out the input using the system's built-in text-to-speech functionality.
- Exits the app when the user types "exit" (case-insensitive).
